---Updated 03.09.2023---

-----What is Tesseract?-----

Tesseract is an AI Machine Learning chatbot developed by Sam Utz. Sam built this bot while learning the AIML language.

-----What can Tesseract Do?----- 

Tesseract currently has some very basic functionality that is going to be improved on as more scenarios pop up.

1. Tesseract can greet and store your name
2. Tesseract can give you a cool fact just by asking "give me a cool fact"
3. Tesseract can tell you how old it is, and what languages it currently speaks
4. Tesseract can store how you are currently feeling by telling it "I am feeling ____"

-----How do I use Tesseract-----

A) If on Windows, run the .bat file named "runTesseract.bat"

B) If on Mac or UNIX, run the .sh file named "runTesseract.sh"

1. After running the bot, interact using the currently available prompts. If the bot responds with "I have no answer for
   that.", please document what you were typing and the response you expected.

-----What is planned next---
1. Continue to create new calls and response for user interaction.
2. Create a profanity/inappropriate filter
3. Looking into a search function where the bot can search google should it not know the answer
4. Be able to load multiple pieces of data using CSV templates
5. Continue to build on the feelings module so that the bot can offer assistance when a user is upset.
